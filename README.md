In this step-by-step tutorial, you'll learn how to craft effective prompts for ChatGPT using Meraki APIs. Whether you're new to Meraki APIs or looking to enhance your prompt-writing skills, this guide will walk you through the essentials. By the end, you'll be able to create powerful, precise, and functional prompts that leverage the capabilities of Meraki APIs to their fullest potential.

**Step 1: Define the Base Prompt**

The first step in creating an effective ChatGPT prompt using Meraki APIs is to define the base prompt. This involves setting basic parameters and clearly specifying your requirements. A well-defined base prompt ensures that ChatGPT understands the task and delivers precise, actionable responses.

**Example Base Prompt:**

```
Create Meraki APIv1 script using Python. Do not exceed more than 10 calls per second. Use the Python requests library and do not use any libraries that are not standard. Run the script on a loop every 5 seconds.
```

**Step 2: API Call**

Once you have your base prompt defined, the next step is to identify the correct Meraki API call that your script needs to execute. Visit the [Meraki API documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/meraki/api-v1/) to find the appropriate API endpoints and understand their parameters.


**Example API Call:**

'''
First API call to run is as follow POST/organizations/{organizationId}/networks
